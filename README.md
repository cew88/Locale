# Locale

## Overview
### Description
Going someplace new? Locale is a travel app to allow individuals new to an area to explore and visit popular landmarks. Locale generates a custom list of landmarks to visit based on user interests and intensity (how many landmarks they want to visit). The app marks locations as visited in real time, prompting users to rate the location, leave a review, and upload an image from their trip after detecting that a user is in a location on their list of locations to visit! Users can see where locations are on a map and view a timeline of their travels on their profile page. No network connection? Locale has limited offline access that allows users to view their list of locations to visit as well as the locations they've visited in the past! Haven't explored someplace new in a while? Locale sends push notifications to users if they have never visited someplace on their list or if they haven't visited someplace new in a couple of days. Locale will also recommend new places to visit based on your current location, so you can always find someplace new to explore!
